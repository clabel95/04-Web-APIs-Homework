The assignment was to create a dynamic webpage using HTML CSS and Javascript. The webpage would take the form of a multiple choice quiz.

The webpage was required to have a timer that would count down to 0. Once the timer reached 0 if the user had not finished the quiz then the quiz would end. 

For each wrong answer that the user chose the timer would lose 10 seconds. 

Once the user either answered all the questions or timed out then they would be prompted with an input for their initials to save their score. 

On submit their initials and scores would be added to a table of Highscores. 

Below the highscores table would be two buttons, one would start the quiz over and the other would erase all highscores.
